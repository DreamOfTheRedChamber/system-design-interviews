## High level architecture

![High level arch](./images/youtube_highlevel_overview.png)

### Video uploading flow
* Upload video

![Upload video](./images/youtube_video_upload.png)

* Upload metadata

![Upload metadata](./images/youtube_video_upload_metadata.png)

### Video streaming flow
#### Streaming protocols
* MPEG
* Apple HLS
* Microsoft Smooth Streaming
* Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming

## Detailed component design
* [Distributed processing at FB scale](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wlloyd/papers/sve-sosp17.pdf)

### Flowchart
* Inspection: Make sure videos have good quality and not malformed.
* Video transcoding: Videos are converted to support different container/codec. 
* Thumbnail: Can be manually uploaded by the user or automatically generated by the system.
* Watermark: An image overlay on top of your video contains identifying information about your video.

### Video transcoding
#### Motivation
* Raw video consumes large amount of storage space. 
* Many browsers and devices only support certain form of encoding.
* To deliver good user experience, it is feasible to deliver high resolution video to users who have high network bandwidth and low resolution video to users who have low network bandwidth. 

#### Encoding format
* Most encoding consists of two components:
  * Container: .avi, .mp4, etc. A basket that contains the video file, metadata, etc.
  * Codecs: Compression and decompression algorithm. 

#### Flowchart

##### Preprocessing
  1. Video splitting: Video stream is split into smaller groups of segments.
  2. DAG generation: Generates DAG based on configuration files client programs write.

##### DAG scheduler
* A sample DAG scheduler

![DAG scheduler](./images/youtube_video_dagScheduler.png)

##### Resource manager
* Contains three queues and a task scheduler
  * Task queue: PQ contains tasks
  * Worker queue: Worker utilization info
  * Running queue: Currently running tasks
  * Task scheduler: Which worker to execute the task
* Process:
  1. The task scheduler gets the highest priority task from the task queue.
  2. The task scheduler gets the optimal task worker to run the task from the worker queue. 
  3. The task scheduler instructs the chosen task worker to run the task.
  4. The task scheduler binds the task/worker info and puts it in the running queue.
  5. The task scheduler removes the job from the running queue once the job is done.

##### Temporary storage
* Multiple storage options are used including blob storage, memory, etc.

### Storage
* How does Youtube serve high quality videos with low latency: https://www.8bitmen.com/youtube-architecture-how-does-it-serve-high-quality-videos-with-low-latency/
* How does Youtube store so many videos: https://www.8bitmen.com/youtube-database-how-does-it-store-so-many-videos-without-running-out-of-storage-space/
