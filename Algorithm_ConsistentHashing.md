# Consistent hashing
## Design thoughts
1. Normal hashing algorithm
	- Cons: Too many items to migrate during resharding
2. Consistent hashing 
	- Cons: Uneven load during scale up/down
3. Consistent hashing with virtual nodes:

## Complexity analysis
* Assume the total number of data M, the total number of nodes N
* Read/write complexity increases from O(1ï¼‰to O(lgn) When compared with traditional hashing because consistent hashing read/write steps are as follow: 
	1. Convert hashkey into 32 bit int number. O(1)
	2. Use binary search to find the corresponding node. O(lgn)
* Data migration complexity decreases from O(m) to O(m/N).
