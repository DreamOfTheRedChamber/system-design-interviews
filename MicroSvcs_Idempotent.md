# Idempotency
## Scenario 
### Network problems or repeated operations
* For example, the point praise function, a user can only point praise once for the same piece of article, repeated point praise prompt has already point praise.

### Third party callbacks
* Our system often needs to deal with third party systems, such as WeChat recharge and Alipay recharge, WeChat and Alipay will often notify you to pay the result by callback your interface. In order to ensure that you receive callbacks, it is often possible to make multiple callbacks.

## Http idempotency
### Safe vs Idempotent Methods
* Safe methods: HTTP methods that do not modify resources. 
* Idempotent methods: HTTP methods that can be called many times without different outcomes. 

| HTTP METHOD  |  USE CASE | IDEMPOTENCE  |  SAFETY  |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | Get resources, no side effect | YES  | YES  |
| HEAD  | Same as GET except no response body | YES | YES  |
| OPTIONS | Used to get the HTTP Methods supported by the URL | YES  | YES  |
| TRACE  | performs a message loop-back test to the target resource | YES  | YES  |
| POST  | Create new resources. e.g. POST http://www.forum.com/articles | NO  | NO  |
| PATCH  | Partially update a resource | NO  | NO  |
| PUT  | Completely update a resource | YES | NO  |
| DELETE | Delete a resource | YES  | NO |

### Why PUT Idempotent and PATCH not
* It's because it matters how you apply your changes. If you'd like to change the name property of a resource, you might send something like {"name": "foo"} as a payload and that would indeed be idempotent since executing this request any number of times would yield the same result: The resources name attribute is now "foo".
* But PATCH is much more general in how you can change a resource (check this definition on how to apply a JSON patch). It could also, for example, mean to move the resource and would look something like this: { "op": "move", "from": "/a/b/c", "path": "/a/b/d" }. This operation is obviously not idempotent since calling at a second time would result in an error.
* So while most PATCH operations might be idempotent, there are some that aren't.

### Why DELETE is Idempotent
* "Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent. "
* The key bit there is the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request.
* You would be correct to expect that the status code would be different but this does not affect the core concept of idempotency - you can send the request more than once without additional changes to the state of the server.

## Implementation
* Idempotency could be implemented in different layers of the service architecture.

### Within standalone applications

### Within DB layer of distributed applications
* Scenario: Operation retry

#### CRUD operations
##### Create/Insert
- Example: Insert user values (uid, name, age, sex, ts) where uid is the primary key
- Needs a little work to guarantee idempotence: If the primary key is generated using DB auto-increment id, then it is not idempotent. The primary key should rely on id which is related with business logic. 

##### Read/Select
- Idempotent

##### Update
- Example (Update to absolute value): Update user set age = 18 where uid = 58. 
	- Suffers from ABA problem in multi-thread environment
		1. current age = 17
		2. operation A: set age = 18
		3. operation B: set age = 19
		4. operation A: set age = 18		
	- Needs optimistic concurrency control (version number) to guarantee idempotence
		1. current age = 17
		2. operation A: set age = 19, v++ where v = 1; 
		3. Operation B: set age = 18, v++ where v = 1;
- Example (Update to relative value): Update user set age++ where uid = 58
	- Convert to absolute example

##### Delete
- Idempotent

#### Avoid replica databases
* See the section within reference: https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/avoiding-double-payments-in-a-distributed-payments-system-2981f6b070bb

#### Unique constraint within DB
* Reference: https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3390-considering-strategies-for-idempotency-without-distributed-locking-with-ben-darfler.htm

### Within business layer of distributed applications
#### Distributed lock
* Scenario: Request only once within a short time window. e.g. User click accidently twice on the order button.
* Please see [Distributed lock](distributedLock.md)

## Generate the idempotency key
### Where
* Layers of architecture: App => Nginx => Network gateway => Business logic => Data access layer => DB / Cache
* Idempotency considerations should reside within data access layer, where CRUD operations happen.
	- The idempotency key could not be generated within app layer due to security reasons
	- The process is similar to OAuth
		1. Step1: App layer generates a code
		2. Step2: App talks to business layer with the generated code to get an idempotency key
		3. Step3: The generated idempotency keys are all stored within an external data store. Busines layer check the external data store with mapping from code => idempotency key
			+ If exist, directly return the idempotency key
			+ Otherwise, generate a new idempotency key, store it within external store and return the generated idempotency key. 
	- An optimization on the process above: Don't always need to check the external data store because repeated requests are minorities. Could rely on DB optimistic concurrency control for it instead of checking every time. For example, below queries will only be executed when there is no conflicts.
		1. insert into … values … on DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE …
		2. update table set status = “paid” where id = xxx and status = “unpaid”;

### How
* Request level idempotency: A random and unique key should be chosen from the client in order to ensure idempotency for the entire entity collection level. For example, if we wanted to allow multiple, different payments for a reservation booking (such as Pay Less Upfront), we just need to make sure the idempotency keys are different. UUID is a good example format to use for this.
* Entity level idempotency: Say we want to ensure that a given $10 payment with ID 1234 would only be refunded $5 once, since we can technically make $5 refund requests twice. We would then want to use a deterministic idempotency key based on the entity model to ensure entity-level idempotency. An example format would be “payment-1234-refund”. Every refund request for a unique payment would consequently be idempotent at the entity-level (Payment 1234).
