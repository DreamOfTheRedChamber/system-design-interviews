## Consistent hashing

### Design thoughts

1. Normal hashing algorithm
   * Cons: Too many items to migrate during resharding
2. Consistent hashing 
   * Cons: Uneven load during scale up/down
3. Consistent hashing with virtual nodes:

### Complexity analysis

* Assume the total number of data M, the total number of nodes N
* Read/write complexity increases from O\(1ï¼‰to O\(lgn\) When compared with traditional hashing because consistent hashing read/write steps are as follow: 
  1. Convert hashkey into 32 bit int number. O\(1\)
  2. Use binary search to find the corresponding node. O\(lgn\)
* Data migration complexity decreases from O\(m\) to O\(m/N\).
