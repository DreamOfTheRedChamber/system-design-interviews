## Scenario
* Write a file
* Read a file
* Use multiple machines to store these files

## Storage
### How to save a file in one machine
* Metadata
	- FileInfo
		+ Name = dengchao.mp4
		+ CreatedTime = 201505031232
		+ Size = 2044323
	- Index
		+ Block 11 -> diskOffset1
		+ Block 12 -> diskOffset2
		+ Block 13 -> diskOffset3
* Block
	- 1 block = 1024 Byte
	- Advantages
		+ Error checking
		+ Fragmenting the data for storage

### How to save a much larger file in one machine 
* Change chunk size
	- 1 chunk = 64M = 64 * 1024K
	- Advantages
		+ Reduce size of metadata
	- Disadvantages
		+ Waste space for small files

## Scale
### Architecture style
* Peer 2 Peer (BitComet, Cassandra)
	- Advantage: No single point of failure
	- Disadvantage: Multiple machines need to negotiate with each other
* Master slave
	- Advantage: Simple design. Easy to keep data consistent
	- Disadvantage: Master is a single point of failure
* Final decision
	- Master + slave
	- Restart the single master

### How to save an extra large file on several machines
* One master + many chunk servers

#### Move chunk offset from master to slaves
* Master don't record the disk offset of a chunk
	- Advantage: Reduce the size of metadata in master; Reduce the traffic between master and chunk server

### Write process
1. The client divides the file into chunks. Create a chunk index for each chunk
2. Send (FileName, chunk index) to master and master replies with assigned chunk servers
3. The client transfer data with the assigned chunk server.

### Do not support modification

### Read process
1. The client sends (FileName) to master and receives a chunk list (chunk index, chunk server) from the master 
2. The client connects with different server for reading files

### Master task
* Store metadata for different files
* Store Map (file name + chunk index -> chunk server)
	- Find corresponding server when reading in data
	- Write to more available chunk server

### Failure and recovery
#### Single master
* Double master (Apache Hadoop Goes Realtime at Facebook)
* Multi master (Paxos algorithm)

#### What if a chunk is broken
* Check sum 4bytes = 32 bit
* Each chunk has a checksum 
* Write checksum when writing out a chunk
* Check checsum when reading in a chunk

#### Avoid loss of data when chunk server is down
* Replica: 3 copies
	- Two copies in the same data center but on different racks
	- Third copy in a different data center
* How to choose chunk servers
	- Find servers which are not busy
	- Find servers with lots of available disk space

#### How to recover when a chunk is broken
* Ask master for help

#### How to find whether a chunk server is down
* Heart beat message

#### How to solve client bottleneck
* Client only writes to a leader chunk server. The leader chunk server is responsible for communicating with other chunk servers. 
* How to select leading slaves

#### How to solve chunk server failure
* Ask the client to retry
