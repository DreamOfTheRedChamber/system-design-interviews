# Why are you looking
## Career growth
* I want to first become an expert in a specific area in 5 years. As long as the problem is within that area, I am always the problem solver and stopper, the go-to person in that area. My current company is roughly 20 years old and has a broad product line. My team is a really small team and it is really hard for me to focus on a specific area. I think there are more such technical specialist positions within big companies and that's why I am looking for a change. 

## Challenges
* I am interested in large-scale distributed systems and data processing. LinkedIn has a global infrastructure, large amounts of data and the 10-year vision of building a global economic graph. Some of the most famous open-source technologies such as Kafka, Samza, Rest.li and Voldemort were born in LinkedIn. The same goes with many famous startups such as Confluent. I think I could contribute and learn a lot here. 

# Why LinkedIn is interesting
* Challenges such in "Why are you looking section". In 2010 ~ 2015, LinkedIn faced a lot of scalability related issues and not a lot of new features come out.
* But in the most recent one year, LinkedIn has built a number of interesting features. There are three features I am especially interested in. Do you want to hear more details. 

## LinkedIn learning
### What has been done
* LinkedIn learning was launched in this year. It is the same as Lynda.com from the content information. But it could provides more personalized recommendations when combined with information from LinkedIn. It is a great effort to make more members engaged. Now no longer is the case that only when they want to change their job, they go back to LinkedIn. Every day they will log into LinkedIn because that's where they learn.

### What do I want to improve
* Problem
	- There are so many MOOC courses and each has its strengths. For example, Coursera wants to bring famous university courses online. Pluralsight focus on professional IT training. Udemy and Lynda.com provides pretty comprehensive contents. For example, from photography to business skills. 
	- LinkedIn has roughly 500 million members and LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every professional. Only suggesting contents from Lynda.com is pretty limited.
	- Nowadays there are too many online courses and it takes time for every member to find the most suitable ones for them. LinkedIn has unique advantages in solving this problem.

* Solution
 	- Instead, I suggest that each online course should have a profile on LinkedIn. LinkedIn learning's recommendations not only suggests content from Lynda.com but also all MOOC courses. When users want to learn some skills online, just ask LinkedIn. By doing this, LinkedIn can become the professional coach for every member. 
 	- This will make users more engaged in LinkedIn and align well with LinkedIn's vision. Personally, I am pretty interested in big data analytics products. LinkedIn provides a number of analytics products such as "People you may know", "Jobs you may be interested in", "Who has viewed your posts", News feed". 

## LinkedIn salary feature
### What has been done
* Although websites such as Glassdoors already provide features such as salary insights, it is too easy to create fake data on these platforms. Everyone has an identity on LinkedIn which could be easily verified and therefore the data from LinkedIn is more authoritative. 
* LinkedIn salary provides you the option to filter salary by company, job title, location, years of experience and industry. 

### What do I want to improve
* Internationalization: It is only available in North America. There are many other regions such as India, France, China where this feature is not available yet. 
* The statistics provided do not offer incisive insights. There are many factors which are not taken into consideration, such average life expenditure and tax in specific areas. For example, although the average salary in San Francisco is much higher than Washington DC, everything is much more expensive here. LinkedIn should help to create more insights about the actual net income. 

## LinkedIn open candidates
### What has been done
* It enables employees to signal that one is "Open to New Opportunities" without alarming your boss.

### What do I want to improve
* This feature should be implemented the other way around: To have allowed those who have no interest in being contacted at all to opt out, rather than requiring users to opt in. The following are my reasons:
	- Surveys also show that at any given time, somewhere between 45 and 85% of people are potentially open to new opportunities. Many passive candidates can be persuaded to look at job opportunities seriously, even if they wouldn’t previously have contemplated doing so. Looking for change should be considered the default behavior for most people on LinkedIn. 
	- Although your exact employer will not be able to see it, this information is really easy to be disclosed. Companies which really care its talents will try every way to prevent their talents going to other companies. I have some concerns about this.
