## Performance
* Query with index should be around 1ms ~ 2ms
* One write should be around 5ms for SSD disk

## CPU capability
* 1 CPU core can handle 200 operation
* Usually database server: 56 CPU cores -&gt; 60 CPU cores or more
* 5-10 CPU cores should be enough without cache
* One database should be good enough to handle the load
