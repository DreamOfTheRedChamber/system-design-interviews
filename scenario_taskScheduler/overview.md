## Task scheduler

### Use cases

* In payment system, if a user has not paid within 30 minutes after ordering. Then this order should be expired and the inventory needs to be reset. Please see the following flowchart:

```
┌────────────────┐                                               ┌────────────────┐

```

* A user scheduled a smart device to perform a specific task at a certain time. When the time comes, the instruction will be pushed to the user's device from the server. 
* Control packet lifetime in networks such as Netty.
* Cron job: 

### Functional features
* Schedule granularity: Execution up to 60x an hour. Set up as many cronjobs as you like. Each of your jobs can be executed up to 60 times an hour. Flexibly configure the execution intervals. Password-protected and SSL-secured URLs are supported.
* Status notifications: If you like, we can inform you by email in case a cronjobs execution fails or is successful again after prior failure. You can find detailed status details in the members area. 
* Execution history: View the latest executions of your cronjobs including status, date and time, durations, and response (header and body). You can also view the three next planned execution dates.



### Real world

* Netflix delay queue: [https://netflixtechblog.com/distributed-delay-queues-based-on-dynomite-6b31eca37fbc](https://netflixtechblog.com/distributed-delay-queues-based-on-dynomite-6b31eca37fbc)

#### Architecture

![MySQL HA github](.gitbook/assets/monitorSystem_HealthCheck_delayedScheduleQueue.png)

#### Delay queue in RabbitMQ

* RabbitMQ does not have a delay queue. But could use timeout as a workaround. 
  1. When put message into a queue, add a timeout value
  2. When the timeout reaches, the message will be put inside a deadqueue
  3. Then the consumer could pull from the deadqueue

#### Redisson ???

#### ScheduledExecutorService ???

#### Beanstalk

* Cons
  * Not convenient when deleting a msg. 
  * Developed based on C language, not Java and PHP. 

#### Others

* db-scheduler / cron.io
* killbill notification queue
* Quartz (Java)
* Xxl-job (Java)
* Celery (Python)
*   Hangfire (C#)
