## System design Interview

### Goal

#### In depth discussion

* There are so many great system design tutorials for beginners in the market: 
  * [donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
  * [checkcheckzz/system-design-interview](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
  * [puncsky/**system-design-and-architecture**](https://github.com/puncsky/system-design-and-architecture)\*\*\*\*
  * Book: [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=sr\_1\_1?dchild=1\&keywords=system+design\&qid=1619578081\&sr=8-1)
  * Course: [Grokking the system design interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
* Learning them does help in interviews because most interviews are super busy people. They typically don't have much time thinking about new interview questions. I really want to take the time to mess around and enjoy it because life is short.
* In-depth discussions is the most effective way for me to understand and remember things. This following blogs really demonstrate what type of in-depth discussions I want to have:
  * [https://kousiknath.medium.com/](https://kousiknath.medium.com)
  * [https://netflixtechblog.com/](https://netflixtechblog.com)
  * 美团技术团队：[https://tech.meituan.com/](https://tech.meituan.com)

#### Graph intensive tutorial

* I am a visual learner and graph is always easier for me to understand things with graph. I especially like tech books published by [Manning](https://www.manning.com) because it is so good at illustrating with pictures. 
* Earlier I was using [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com) for pictures. Recently I started using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) because it was easier to use and maintain.
