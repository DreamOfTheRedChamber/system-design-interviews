# System design Interview

## Philosophy

* Coco Chanel [The best things in life are free](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/opinion/are-the-best-things-in-life-free.html)

>> "The best things in life are free. The second best things are very, very expensive."

* DHH on [Basecamp journey on Observer](https://observer.com/2015/12/the-day-i-became-a-millionaire/)

>> "While the quote above rings true, I’d add that the difference between the best things  and the second best things is far, far greater than the difference between the second best things and the twentieth best things. It’s not a linear scale."

* Yanni on [Yanni – “Tribute ”… The “Tribute” Concerts!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibuNS5hS1js&list=RDMMZ1m7-gNdiKk&index=3&ab_channel=Yanni)

>> I remembered that when I was young, my father would take me for these long walks on these Greek mountains. He was always trying to teach us Simplicity and appreciation to nature. The best things in life, are available to everyone because they are inside us, like truth, imagination, creativity, love, kindness, compassion! Greatness has nothing to do with money, success or possessions. 

## Intentions

### Question driven evolvement
* In real life, software systems are not completely designed, but also evolving with reallife problems. 
* The content will try to be structured in a question driven way instead of random solutions haphazardly assembled together. 

### Graph intensive tutorial

* I am a visual learner and graph is always easier for me to understand things with graph. I especially like tech books published by [Manning](https://www.manning.com) because it is so good at illustrating with pictures. 
* Earlier I was using [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com) for pictures. Recently I started using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) and [Whimscal](https://whimsical.com/) because it was easier to use and maintain. 

### Translate great Chinese articles to English

* There are many professionals translating great English articles (such as InfoQ) to China. However, there isn't a lot of effort in translating great Chinese articles to English. 
* Please see this [对中美信息流动不对称的几点思考](https://www.36kr.com/p/1721045843969) for details.

### In depth discussions
* Learning them does help in interviews because most interviews are super busy people. They typically don't have much time thinking about new interview questions. I really want to take the time to mess around and enjoy it because life is short.
* In-depth discussions is the most effective way for me to understand and remember things. This following blogs really demonstrate what type of in-depth discussions I want to have:
  * [https://netflixtechblog.com/](https://netflixtechblog.com)
  * [PostGreSQL master: Brandur at Crunchy Data](https://brandur.org/articles)
  * [Long discussions on random topics: https://kousiknath.medium.com/](https://kousiknath.medium.com)

## Roadmap

* There are two types of TODOs in the repo
  * The first is a topic on the left hand rail directly marked as TODO. It is a topic that I am interested in but haven't got time to learn systematically about it. 
  * The second is a TODO listed inside the bottom of a discussion topic. It typically links to a blog / resource that I want to read further but haven't got time to. 

* You could see the roadmap of this system design repo at this [Github Project Page](https://github.com/users/DreamOfTheRedChamber/projects/1/views/1)
