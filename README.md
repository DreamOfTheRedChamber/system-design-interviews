# System design Interview

## Philosophy
* I feel deeply resonated with what DHH described in his [basecamp journey](https://observer.com/2015/12/the-day-i-became-a-millionaire/)
* For me, learning and writing is something giving me deep and long-term satisfaction, ;D

>> "The best things in life are free. The second best things are very, very expensive."
>> Coco Chanel

>> "While the quote above rings true, I’d add that the difference between the best things  and the second best things is far, far greater than the difference between the second best things and the twentieth best things. It’s not a linear scale."
>> DHH

## Intentions

### In depth discussion

* There are so many great system design tutorials for beginners in the market: 
  * [donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
  * [checkcheckzz/system-design-interview](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
  * [puncsky/system-design-and-architecture](https://github.com/puncsky/system-design-and-architecture)
  * [eileen-code4fun/SystemDesignInterviews](https://github.com/eileen-code4fun/SystemDesignInterviews)
  * Book: [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=sr\_1\_1?dchild=1\&keywords=system+design\&qid=1619578081\&sr=8-1)
  * Course: [Grokking the system design interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
* Learning them does help in interviews because most interviews are super busy people. They typically don't have much time thinking about new interview questions. I really want to take the time to mess around and enjoy it because life is short.
* In-depth discussions is the most effective way for me to understand and remember things. This following blogs really demonstrate what type of in-depth discussions I want to have:
  * [https://kousiknath.medium.com/](https://kousiknath.medium.com)
  * [https://netflixtechblog.com/](https://netflixtechblog.com)
  * 美团技术团队: [https://tech.meituan.com/](https://tech.meituan.com)
  * 即时通讯网: [http://www.52im.net/](http://www.52im.net/)

### Graph intensive tutorial

* I am a visual learner and graph is always easier for me to understand things with graph. I especially like tech books published by [Manning](https://www.manning.com) because it is so good at illustrating with pictures. 
* Earlier I was using [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com) for pictures. Recently I started using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) and [Whimscal](https://whimsical.com/) because it was easier to use and maintain. 

### Translate great Chinese articles to US

* There are many professionals translating great English articles (such as InfoQ) to China. However, there isn't a lot of effort in translating great Chinese articles to English. 
* Please see this [对中美信息流动不对称的几点思考](https://www.36kr.com/p/1721045843969) for details.

## Roadmap

* There are two types of TODOs in the repo
  * The first is a topic on the left hand rail directly marked as TODO. It is a topic that I am interested in but haven't got time to learn systematically about it. 
  * The second is a TODO listed inside the bottom of a discussion topic. It typically links to a blog / resource that I want to read further but haven't got time to. 

* You could see the roadmap of this system design repo at this [Github Project Page](https://github.com/users/DreamOfTheRedChamber/projects/1/views/1)
